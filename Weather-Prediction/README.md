# Weather-Prediction

A Weather Forcasting model which has been trained over the dataset of 2 years time from 1 May 2016 to 11 March 2018. The dataset is specific to the city Jaipur, India.

And can gathered any location data with the help API of underground by giving it's latitude and longitude of the Weather Station.

## Model

The model is trained over Neural Network with DNN Regresor over the Tensor Flow.

## Accuracy

The accuracy of the model is obtained of 90%. Which can be improved by feeding more dataset on it.
